A Simple jQuery Slideshow  
by Philip Andersson

To use this plugin:  
drop these files in whichever folder you store JavaScript and CSS files in  

jQuery files:  
add the following lines to your header:
```
<script src="-directory-/jquery.js"></script>  
<script src="-directory-/slideshow.js"></script>  
```
change -directory- to the folder in which you dropped these files in, could be "js" or "script"  

CSS files:  
add the following line to your header:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="-directory-/slideshow.css">  
```
change -directory- to  the folder in which you dropped these files in, could be "css" or "style"  
or  
import via your main stylesheet with
```
@import url(-directory-/slideshow.css);  
```
-directory-/ should be removed if both stylesheets lie in the same directory
